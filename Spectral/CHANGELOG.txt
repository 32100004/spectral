    * Created new directories for Algorithms and Utilities.
    * Encapsulated classification algorithms into classes.
    * Added status display object for cleaner status output.

	* __init__.py:
	  Changed several imports due to package restructuring.
	  Setting package-level status member.
	  Incremented SPy version to 0.2
	* Spectral.py (tileImage): Now reads SubImages instead of SubRegions.
	* Algorithms/Algorithms.py : Moved file from Spectral/.
	  Added iterator classes and functions for generic iteration over image
	    pixels.
	  (mean_cov): Now additionally returns number of pixels used in
	    calculating the mean and std dev.
	  (TrainingSet) Several changes and is renamed TrainingClass.
	* Algorithms/__init__.py: New file.
	* Algorithms/Classifiers.py: New file.
	* Algorithms/Cluster.py: Moved from Spectral/.
	* Io/BilFile.py (readSubRegion): Upper bound is now exclusive to match
	  python slice syntax
	* Io/BipFile.py: ditto
	* Io/BsqFile.py: ditto
	* Io/SpyFile.py (TransformedImage): Fixed broken logic for reading
	  data from TransformedImage objects.
	* Utilities/__init__.py: New file.
	* Utilities/Status.py: New file containing StatusDisplay class that
	  provides pretty output for status messages.
