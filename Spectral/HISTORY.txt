SPy 0.4
================================================================================
Release date: 2008.02.28

- New Features: None

- Changes

  - Migrated from Numeric to NumPy.

  - Migrated to wxPython 2.8+.

  - Now compatible with Python 2.5.


SPy 0.3
================================================================================
Release date: 2006.07.19

- New Features:

  - Neural network classifier (PerceptronClassifier) added.  This classifier
    is implementad as a Multi-Layer Perceptron with a single hidden layer. As
    with neural networks in general, choosing the right number of hidden layer
    neurons heavily influences training time and final classification accuracy.

  - Hypercube visualization added.  Call the hypercube function to render
    an interactive hypercube that can be translated, rotated, and stretched.
    You can also specify the image bands to display on the top face of the cube,
    as well as the color scale to be used on the sides.  PyOpenGL and GLUT must
    be installed to render hypercubes.

  - SPECTRAL_DATA environment variable is now searched for file names passed to
    the image function. SPECTRAL_DATA is expected to be a semicolon-delimited
    list of directory names.  As one would expect, the current working directory
    is always searched first.

- Changes

  - The TrainingClassSet class was introduced to replace the simple list of
    TrainingClass objects that was previously being passed to classifiers.
    This provides a more generic interface for extending SPy capabilities and
    allows generic iterators to be used for both training and classification.

  - The canonicalAnalysis function (which was a misnomer) was renamed to
    linearDiscriminant (which is also aliased to lda).

  - The transformStatistics method of SpyFile and TrainingClass was renamed to
    just transform.  For TrainingClass, this method should rarely be called
    anyway because the TrainigClassSet.transform method handles applying
    the transform to all associated TrainingClass objects.


SPy 0.2
================================================================================
Release date: 2006.06.16

- New Features:

  - BSQ interleaved files are now supported.
  - Mahalanobis Classifier has been added.

- Package layout has changed in a few significant ways:

  - There is now an Algorithms sub-package.
  - Classification algorithms are now python classes, derived from Classifier.
  - Iterators are now used for many algorithms.

- Better progress indicator output for lengthy operations and integration with
  other tools.


SPy 0.1
================================================================================
Release date: 2001.11.28

This is the initial release of SPy.
